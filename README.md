# Assessment


## Self-Assessment

This project was a great opportunity to work as a part of a team and realize our first data analysis project. This was a an experience of how a real data analysis project would be in real job. My contribution was in creating a Dashbord with HTML and JavaScript.  

### Data Visualization and interactive Dashboard

#### Crossfilter 
In the data visualization field, there is multiple options to create an interactive dashboard. We opted in the first place to use Crossfilters and D3 with HTML and JavaScript. 
Crossfilter is a multi-dimensional dataset. Crossfilter is defined under the crossfilter namespace. It uses semantic versioning. 
Starting coding the cross filter, the first issue we faced is dimensioning the data. We need Multiple dimensions for the data to be interactive. Unfortunately, the type of data that we have can only be displayed in one dimension: Covid cases by places and date and total vaccination. 
The second major issue is time. The time frame to learn a new concept and use it in a short period was a challenge. 
Crossfilter is a great opportunity to create an interactive HTML dashboard. Using D3 to present and manage the data.

#### Plotly 

Plotly was very helpful to create visualization and graph the data. We used with Javascrip and we created some onclick event in the HTML page to make it interactive.  !!!Link HTML 
Great opportunity is offered by Plotly to create animated graphs. Plotly.Express. Link jupiterNotebook 

#### ConvasJs

ConvasJs is great library in JavaScript to create animated and complicated graphs. Fist challenge we had is the data format didn’t help to plot an animated graph using ConvasJs. Also, this library is paid and need a license for a professional use.  !!!!Link ConvasJsTest.html file 

#### Tableau 

Using tableau was a great alternative to create a dashboard to filter the plots offered to the user. We used Embed Code offered in tableau public to insert in our dashboard tab. 

 
 #### Conclusion 

In summary I was able to combine all these technologies was a great opportunity to test and use them together. We have an HTML page with 3 Tabs
1-	Home uses Plotly and JavaScript to filter the data 
2-	Map: interactive map with API and Leaflet that shows the top safest places to visit with hotel information 
3-	Dashboard: offers extras analytics for the user with tableau 



## Team Assessment

The choice for my teammates was from the study group we worked on since the first day of this bootcamp. The group was coherent and we able to talk the subject, steps and individual tasks. We had a great respect for each other’s work and time. We also had a good communication. 
Whoever is available will join the zoom to troubleshoot or make decision based on results. We had meetings 3 times a week to review the work progress and explain the codes we have. 
Their strengths as a team, was the support and availability we had for each other. Troubleshoot errors for each other’s. 



## Summary of Project


The Topic of this project is Tops 10 Covid safest places to visit for a vacation
We first load the data for Covid cases and vaccination. We did an ETL process to clean and transform the data to our database. Then we used Machine learning The Random Forest Regressor algorithm to make predictions. The results were 99% accuracy. Then we used the top 10 places to plot in an interactive map and create an interactive dashboard for the analytics information.
